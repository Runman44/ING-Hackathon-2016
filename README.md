## Project: FlyING Lion

#### Purpose

We wanted a fun way of collecting creditpoints for a ING customer. With these points the customer can buy products in the credit store. But to give ING more insight in their customers the game will ask certain questions. These questions will be easy to answer but will give ING more information. 

As a bonus, this game is made in Unity which can port the game to almost every platform there is. 

#### Game Rules

For this game we defined a set of rules. How will the lion die, how will the lion collect the packages. After some discussions we came up with the following rules:

+ The game starts with 100 seconds that will decrease every second. 
+ The game is over when the timer hits 0. 
+ The player can keep alive by collection coins. Each coin is worth 1 second of time. 
+ The player should collect as many packages as possible. The player with the most packages collected in a game wins.
